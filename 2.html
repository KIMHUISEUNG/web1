    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Dependent sheets or cascading style sheets (CSSs) are languages[1] that describe how markup languages are actually displayed, mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layout and style.

If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of a website, CSS is responsible for decorating like clothing and accessories. That is, if you leave the HTML structure intact and just change the CSS file, you can decorate it like a completely different website.

In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed, features such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations have been added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs. Various animation features have also been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.</p>
